# Interactions with Beijing have long been a political test for Hong Kong’s leaders – now it’s John Lee’s turn
> By Tammy Tam, SCMP

The key points
* It would be odd for both sides to keep up any pretence of maintaining a distance, as political practices over time have changed
* Proper communication between Lee and officials up north has become a practical reality, and all eyes will be on how he makes use of the ‘one country, two systems’ policy

> In politics, it is revealing to see how certain practices once considered taboo can become publicly acceptable as the new normal.

Whether certain practices considered taboo depends on the time and political atmosphere. Compared to what it seemed as 10 years ago, the condition now is totally different, due to the introduction of National Security Law. And the Beijing-Hongkong leadership relations are substantially closer.

> Lee’s office gave the media a heads-up, making it as normal as his other open engagements. Luo Huining, Beijing’s envoy, greeted Lee at the front gate of the liaison office, allowing a brief photo opportunity to the crowd of journalists in tow. There was no political outcry.  
> Turn back the clock just 10 years, and it was a completely different story.

10 years ago, Hong Kong had a high degree of autonomy.But then, changes began to take place. On the one hand, a series of political movement, such as Umbrellal Revolution, made Beijing feel its rule over Hong Kong was threatened. On the other hand, with President Xi's rise to power, Beijing has begun to act incredible forceful on everything, especially Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan affairs.

> That kind of fuss has become a thing of the past, with Beijing now enforcing its uncompromising principle of “patriots ruling Hong Kong”. And whatever the circumstances, it would be odd for the two sides to keep up any pretence of maintaining a distance, since Hong Kong’s chief executive must be accountable to the central government as well.

Certanly, John Lee is the chosen "patriots".

> However, the fact that Lee’s meetings with locally based mainland officials did not spark any political outcry this time is only one side of the coin – the other is how he can take the best advantage of the one country, two systems policy.

No spark, is due to the impact of NSL on Hong Kong's political enviroment, or alternatively, the fact that Hong Kong has hit the bottom because of 2019 political movement, covid-19, thus people are eager to see a Chief Executive from police system starting a new chapter for this city.
